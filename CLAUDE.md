# Project Guidelines

This monorepo contains simple web and Node.js applications for YouTube demonstration purposes.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript for all code unless a different language is absolutely necessary
- **Web Apps**: Latest Angular framework
- **Backend Apps**: Node.js with Express for server functionality when needed
  - Keep dependencies minimal
  - No heavy frameworks required

## Repository Structure

Each subfolder at the root level represents a separate application:

```
/
├── app-name-1/
├── app-name-2/
├── app-name-3/
└── ...
```

## Development Principles

- Keep applications simple and focused for demonstration purposes
- Minimize external dependencies where possible
- Use TypeScript's type safety throughout
- Follow modern best practices for each technology stack
